# DialogDetective

Automatically identify and rename unknown video files by analyzing their audio content.

## How it works

1. Extract audio from video files
2. Convert speech to text using STT
3. Fetch episode descriptions from the internet
4. Use LLM to match dialogue with episode metadata
5. Rename files with correct series, season, episode number, and title

## Name

**DialogDetective** was chosen from 10+ candidates including EpisodeOracle, SeriesWhisperer, and AudioArchaeologist. The name emphasizes the investigative process of using dialogue to solve the mystery of unnamed files.

## Theming

The project embraces detective terminology throughout:
- "Investigating" files
- "Cases" for processing jobs
- "Clues" from audio analysis
- "Solving" when a match is found
- "Evidence" for confidence scores
